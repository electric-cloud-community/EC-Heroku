        <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:5981BD

                What is the tool itself is used for in the development

                process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or

                problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or

                website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other

                outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their

                documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word

                only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

                -->

        <p>Heroku is a cloud platform as a service or PaaS,
        supporting several programming languages. It is known for
        being one of the first cloud platforms, and has been in
        development since June 2007 when it supported the Ruby
        programming language, but since has added support for Java,
        Node.js, Scala, Clojure and Python and PHP. Heroku claims
        to offer the most NoSQL add-on solutions in the market
        today and that it introduced the 'polyglot platform', also
        it is recognized by many as one of the best cloud computer
        services available. It can be easily used through console
        and provide a very robust Web API.</p>

        <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to Heroku</h2>
        <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:

                How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general

                functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does

                the plugin omit?

                -->
        <!--p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the Heroku web services via HTTP Requests
                    and passes the user-provided parameters.</p-->

        <p>The @PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin is open, it allows the input of
        many Heroku functions defined in the provided fields of the
        parameters. Is important to provide all the parameters
        required for the correct functioning of the Heroku
        plugin.</p>

        <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
        parameters checking, easy functionality selection using
        only check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports,
        procedure duration statistics, simple credentials
        attachment, real time analysis of the log been generated,
        among others.</p>

        <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

        <p>This plugin was developed and tested against Heroku
        version 2.31.4 (ruby v.1.9.2)</p>

        <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>
		<p>IMPORTANT: In the ElectricFlow UI, from the Home page, open the Main Menu, and click <b>Admin</b> &gt; <b>Plugins</b> to open the Plugin Manager.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below,
        required parameters are shown in

            you'll need to have created a remote to Heroku. Finally
            you need to have the Heroku keys correctly configured

        <h2>Example: Create Configuration, Create Application, Add
        Collaborator, Restart Processes and Destroy
        Application.</h2>

        <p>The first step is to create a configuration with your
        Heroku <span class="required">API Key</span>, wich is
        available at your
        <a href="https://api.heroku.com/account">Account</a>
        page.</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/Config.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>With the configuration ready, it is possible to use any
        of the procedures provided. For this example we will start
        by creating a new Heroku App, in order to do this it is
        necesary to access the Application Management procedure and
        provide the requested
        parameters:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement1.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>Once the parameters are set, now you are able to execute
        the step. The result is
        succesful:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement2.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>It is also possible to check the response from Heroku by
        entering the
        log:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement3.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>As a final revision, the application should appear at
        your Heroku
        dashboard:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement4.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>To continue with the example, it is possible to manage
        Collaborators of an App by entering the Collaborator
        Management procedure, in this case a new collaborator will
        be added toe the "new-city"
        application:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/CollaboratorManagement1.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>Once the parameters are set, now you are able to execute
        the step. The result is
        succesful:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/CollaboratorManagement2.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>For this case it is also possible to check the response
        from Heroku by entering the
        log:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/CollaboratorManagement3.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>By default the application "new-city" was created with
        one process active, called "web.1". By accessing the
        Process Management procedure it is possible to set any
        number of processes, according to the needs and budget of
        your application; it is also possible to restart or stop
        the procedures when it is required. For this example the
        only process called "web.1" will be
        restarted:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ProcessManagement1.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>Once the parameters are set, now you are able to execute
        the step. The result is
        succesful:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ProcessManagement2.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>It is also possible to check the response body from
        Heroku by entering the
        log:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ProcessManagement3.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>As final action for thi example the application will be
        destroyed using the procedure Application Management. It is
        necesary to provide the following
        parameters:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement5.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>Once the parameters are set, now you are able to execute
        the step. The result is
        succesful:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement2.png" alt="screenshot" /> 

        <p>It is also possible to check the response body from
        Heroku by entering the log, in this case the action was
        destroy, and for that the response body is
        empty:</p><img src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/ApplicationManagement6.png" alt="screenshot" />
